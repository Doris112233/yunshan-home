  'programs.investigation.empower.reason':
    'During our cooperation with authorities of protected areas, it turns out that frontline rangers often have fewer opportunities to receive systematic and professional training in field surveys, as well as methods and tools for patrolling and monitoring. At the beginning of Cloudmountain establishment, we have applied for the Lancang River Conservation Project from Shan Shui Conservation Center, which supported the Western Black-crowned Gibbon Conservation Ability Enhancement Training Project at Mt. Yongde, Yunnan. The program was followed by training in gibbon song survey and monitoring methods, trap camera deployment, use of binoculars and other skills in Yingjiang and Changning. About 40 rangers were trained, 10 of whom have become the striking force in gibbon monitoring and field surveys in the various protected areas.',
  'programs.investigation.empower.description':
    'We have been paying great attention to empowering rangers from protected areas and forestry departments to become more professional in patrolling, monitoring, and publicity while carrying out our projects. In the Western Black-crowned Gibbon Conservation Ability Enhancement Training Project at Mt. Yongde, we assessed the effectiveness of the program, made necessary adjustments and improvements to the program, and reviewed it as a whole based on the feedback from the monitoring ranger team. We also provided further technical guidance to the monitoring team members to enhance their technical ability in patrolling. Also, we carried out training in gibbon song survey and monitoring methods, trap camera deployment, use of binoculars, and other skills in Yingjiang and Changning respectively. After the training and unifying monitoring and data recording methods, we analyzed the data and fed the suggestions of the next step adjustments back to the monitoring team members and the conservation authorities department, which helped them to grant a greater sense of achievement from their daily patrol monitoring.',

  'programs.investigation.canteen.reason.1':
    'In Yingjiang County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, which is the main distribution area of Skywalker Hoolock gibbon, Cloudmountain Conservation, together with Yunnan Tongbiguan Provincial Nature Reserve, carried out a comprehensive population survey, which found that the vast majority of the population of Skywalker Hoolock gibbon in Yingjiang County is located in state-owned forests, collective forests, and individual forests outside the Reserve.',
  'programs.investigation.canteen.reason.2':
    'Among them, the distribution of Skywalker Hoolock gibbon population in the Lamahe of Sudian Township, Yingjiang County, is of particular value for conservation. The habitat here is severely fragmented, yet there are five family groups and two solitary apes living in an area of about 13 square kilometers, and the range of activity of the gibbons here is more concentrated than that of the population in the Mt. Gaoligong National Nature Reserve. There is ample evidence that habitats outside protected areas, such as the Lama River area, have been affected by more anthropogenic disturbances, such as roads, logging, forest degradation, and daily production and living activities by neighboring communities, than inside the protected area, but why is this area hosting the most concentrated population of Skywalker Hoolock gibbons in Yingjiang County?',
  'programs.investigation.canteen.reason.3':
    'We propose a possible answer to the above question: the presence of anthropogenic disturbances and habitat degradation outside the reserve, while negatively affecting the survival of gibbons, also acts as a disincentive to potential food competitors of the gibbons, especially other non-human primates; thus the competitive feeding pressure on the populations of the gibbons outside the nature reserves, such as in the Lamahe area, is less than that insides.',
  'programs.investigation.canteen.reason.4':
    'To test this hypothesis, we would like to carry out a survey targeting gibbon food trees in the habitat of Skywalker Hoolock gibbon in the Lama River Area of Yingjiang County. We will select the most important food tree species for Skywalker Hoolock gibbon in each season, and by deploying infrared cameras in the different canopy layers, we will record the whole process of the feeding and all the feeders and compare it with the relevant data in the protected area.',
  'programs.investigation.canteen.description.1':
    "In September 2022, through the fundraising of Tencent Public Welfare's “99 Giving Day”, we carried out the “Gibbon Canteen Survey Program”. Through infrared camera surveys in the canopy, we can validate the existing data on the feeding habits of gibbons in the reserve, collect data on the feeding behaviors of non-habituated gibbon populations, and obtain a list of species that eaten in the “canteen” by gibbons, and yield recommendations for habitat restoration from the perspective of food abundance.",
  'programs.investigation.canteen.description.2':
    'As of March 2024, we have deployed 295 infrared cameras and captured 290,000 infrared images, totaling 12 terabytes, through this project. We have photographed many feeding events of three gibbon groups, and documented over 50 species of birds and 20 other species of animals, including slow lorises and macaques. In addition, the infrared cameras recorded two newborn infants in two different groups respectively, and gibbons were photographed in secondary forests and high altitude areas where we thought gibbons would not go.',
  'programs.investigation.canteen.description.3':
    'A large volume of images and videos needs to be sorted and identified by volunteers. Since the start of the project, we have been recruiting online volunteers, who are interested in conservation and research in wildlife but do not have a scientific background can also contribute. Up to now (May 2024), we have conducted seven rounds of infrared camera deployment, and more than 180 people have signed up and participated in online training to become volunteers for the project. Compared to 2023, we have expanded the survey area in 2024 to clearly understand the range of gibbon activities in this area, especially their feeding range and patterns, and the family dynamics of each family group through long-term monitoring. This will indicate the specific direction and scope of concern for community conservation actions.',

  'programs.investigation.cloud.reason':
    'Banchang Conservation and Filed Research Station of Mt. Gaoligong, located in Mt. Gaoligong National Nature Reserve Area, belongs to Baihualing in Country Longyang, City Baoshan, where Prof. Fan Pengfei and his research group has been working on gibbon field monitoring and scientific research continuously for 7 years since 2011. Cloudmountain Conservation started a collaborative program named “Banchang Conservation and Filed Research Station of Mt. Gaoligong” since January 2019, under the funding of 2018 and 2019 Tencent 99 Giving Day. A tripartite agreement on co-construction and co-management was signed together with the Baoshan department of the Mt. gaoLigong National Nature Reserve Area and Sun Yat-sen University. A two-year-long work at the station was then carried out.',
  'programs.investigation.cloud.description.1':
    'Banchang Station has explored, as well as practiced the model of co-construction and co-management among the protected area, public welfare organizations and scientific research team as a tripartite management mode. Banchang Station has set up and educated a long-term field-based work team, including 1 manager, 2-4 monitoring guides, and 2-4 interns within 2 years. Banchang Station also carried out ecological and behavioral monitoring in multiple species, including Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon as a flagship species, designed and implemented public participation in scientific research and conservation activities, and linked the media and various types of cross-border cooperation to make Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon and the biodiversity of the Gaoligong Mountains more widely known.',
  'programs.investigation.cloud.description.2':
    'Long-term field monitoring has accumulated continuous and accurate data about Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon population information, behavior patterns, and other ecological aspects, provided important information on Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon’s calls and songs, diets and foraging pattern, habitat usage, sympatric species, and relationships with human activities which might help conservation decisions and actions.',
  'programs.investigation.cloud.description.3':
    'The online and in-person public engagement activities organically linked the real and frontline conservation program to new generations and related fields, broadening the gates of participation in nature conservation work. Scientific communication with precision and initiative cross-border cooperation has enabled the stories of Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon and biodiversity conservation and conservationists working on their habitats to become more widely known.',

  'programs.investigation.gene.reason':
    'Starting from 2018, in order to study whether there is any genetic flow among different small populations of Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon in China under severe habitat fragmentation, under three different fundings, including two continuous 99 Giving Day, namely "Protecting the Last Home of the Skywalking Gibbon" and "Alipay\'s Small and Beautiful - Protecting the Apes\' Residents\' Homes" respectively, and the Third "Towards Ecological Civilization: A Tribute to Environmental Pioneers" Environmental Public Welfare Project. With gibbon feces considered the most accessible genetic information of the Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon, we have been carrying out the gathering of feces in different habitats in which gibbon populations haven’t been habituated since then, and keep working on it these days.',
  'programs.investigation.gene.description.1':
    'We had been carrying out gibbon feces collection with searching dog since March 2018, attempts have been made in the Banchang Research Center and Nankang Nature Park located in Mt. Gaoligong in which the gibbon population has already been habituated.',
  'programs.investigation.gene.description.2':
    'Also, we tried to search for gibbon feces at the Datang area in Mt.gaoligong National Conservation Area, Tengchong. With no successful results, we went to Yingjiang to continue our work. In October 2018, we made our first attempt in Lishu and found our first feces sample from the un-habituated Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon population.',
  'programs.investigation.gene.description.3':
    'Since then, until June 2021, with the companionship of a searching dog, we kept on searching for gibbon feces in 7 different villages located in Sudian and Zhina. During searching process, we found a corpse sample of old male gibbon in one of Lamahe gibbon habitats. April 2021, Li Ruxue from Cloudmountain Conservation, PhD student Huang Xia from Sun Yat-sen University, Cloudmoutain intern Mou Jinsong and Yuan Yi worked together in corporate with Dr. Huang Xia, completed the collection of feces from gibbons rescued by the Dehong Wildlife Rescue Center, In which will help with a better understanding of the genetic diversity of gibbons.',

  'programs.investigation.population.reason':
    'In 2019, under the funding of the Third "Towards Ecological Civilization: A Tribute to Environmental Pioneers" Environmental Public Welfare Project and the Alashan SEE Joint Public Welfare Project, we carried out two projects, namely, "Protecting the Last Home of the Skywalker Gibbons" and "Alipay\'s Small and Beautiful - Protecting the Apes\' Residents\' Homes", to understand the quality and connectivity of Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon’s habitat in key areas, also to promote the gene exchange among different gibbon populations. To make good progress in the conservation of Hoolock Skywalker outside the protected areas.',
  'programs.investigation.population.description.1':
    'We have trained more than 10 rangers and field guides to monitor the population dynamics of Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon in the Yingjiang area. By the time of June 2020, we had confirmed the population size and distribution of Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon in ZhiNa and Sudian in Yingjiang(continuously updating).',
  'programs.investigation.population.description.2':
    'Based on what we have learned from gibbon population dynamics monitoring, in order to understand the quality, food abundance, and connectivity of gibbon habitat, we carried out a survey of plant samples within the habitats of three family groups in Yingjiang, and put up signage for gibbon families’ food trees. By comparing samples from habitats with different levels of utilization by gibbons, and analyzing the possible reasons for the different levels of utilization from the perspective of habitat plant distribution, we have come up with certain recommendations for how to improve the quality of existing gibbon habitats and expanding the range of high-quality habitats.',

  'programs.investigation.habitat.reason.1':
    "Nomascus leucogenys, a special kind of gibbon used to be distributed in southern Yunnan province, however, because of rubber planting and large-scale reclamation of tropical rainforests in the low-altitude areas of southern Yunnan, the population declined rapidly in the 1980s. During Prof. Fan Pengfei's 2011 field survey, no traces of the gibbon were found in its former habitat. Since there were no records of Nomascus leucogenys in other regions, this species was considered to be extinct in the wild in China.",
  'programs.investigation.habitat.reason.2':
    'According to the survey of the Nomascus leucogenys, we learned that Hylobates lar, Nomascus concolor, and Hoolock tianixing may also have distribution areas that have never been covered by any kind survey. Thus, establishing the necessary conservation measures for these important gibbon habitats outside of protected areas turns out to be essential to ensure the future growth of gibbon populations.',
  'programs.investigation.habitat.reason.3':
    'From 2018 to 2021, under the funding of the Third "Towards Ecological Civilization: A Tribute to Environmental Pioneers" Environmental Public Welfare Project and the Alashan SEE Joint Public Welfare Project, we carried out two projects, namely, "Protecting the Last Home of the Skywalker Gibbon" and "Alipay\'s Small and Beautiful - Protecting the Apes\' Residents\' Homes", we carried out Community and fieldwork Survey aiming at 4 mentioned kinds of Gibbon.',
  'programs.investigation.habitat.description.1':
    "After synthesizing the important historical distribution information and potential clues obtained from several community surveys, exchanges with local protected areas, and suggestions from scientific experts, we traveled to Menglian, Jiangcheng, and Ning'er in Pu'er, Mengla in Xishuangbanna, and Yingjiang in Dehong to carry out surveys. After some more detailed community surveys, we combined clues form these surveys with satellite map analysis. Finally, we found out some prioritized survey areas and carried out field surveys in those areas. ",
  'programs.investigation.habitat.description.2':
    'We put up acoustic monitor device to collect acoustic data in the forests of Country Menglian, Yiwu in Country Mengla, Kachang and Mangzhang in Country Yingjiang, making effort in replacing manpower with auto acoustic monitoring devices in gibbon distribution surveys. More than 70 listening sites were set up within the potential distribution areas of three different species of gibbon, and 8,289 hours of acoustic data were obtained.',
  'programs.investigation.habitat.description.3':
    'With the information and personnel support provided by Tongbiguan Nature Reserve, we discovered a female solitary Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon in Kachang, Yingjiang County, and a small self-sustaining population of Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon in Mangzhang. Our discovery expands the original area which was believed to be habitat of Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon, and directly add numbers to the population size of Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon in China, providing more security and possibilities for the survival and development of this endangered species. The activity area of the female solitary gibbon found in Kachang this time had also set a new record for the southernmost point of Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon’s geographical distribution in Yingjiang.',

  'programs.community.education.reason':
    'The Wuliang and Ailao Mountain National Nature Reserve in Yunnan Province is a nature reserve in the category of forest ecosystems and wildlife, with the forest ecosystem of the mid-mountain moist evergreen broad-leaved forests and the endangered wildlife there as its main objects of protection. The reserve has rich species resources, including four national first-class protected plant species (Taxus chinensis, Alcimandra cathcartii, etc) and 11 national first-class protected animals (Nomascus concolor, Trachypithecus crepusculus, etc). The nature reserve covers an area of 1,470,000 acres and over 50,000 people live in surrounding areas. In order to better conduct conservation research, educate surrounding neighborhoods to increase conservation awareness, and gain general support from people, Cloudmountain Conservation has been cooperating with institutes like the Jingdong Department of Mt. Wuliang and Ailao National Nature Reserve since 2019. A series of science popularization programs have been done in primary schools near gibbon habitats.',
  'programs.community.education.description.1':
    'From March to July 2019, the “Little Ambassador of Gibbons” science popularization program was carried out in nearby primary schools. There were in-class activities such as “understand gibbons in our hometown” and “protect China’s gibbon, bring science to campus”, themed parties, big frame paintings of gibbons, and so on. The combination of in-class conservation education and themed parties successfully promoted local science popularization a step forward. Local conservation agencies will continuously bring Western Black Crested Gibbon to children living in the mountains in a joyful and informative way.',
  'programs.community.education.description.2':
    'From July to September 2021, the Two Mountain (Wuliang & Ailao) Natural Education and Experience Program developed and conducted many science popularization classes and natural week programs in schools. These programs aimed at helping students to understand and appreciate the local natural environment, allowing local young people to gradually comprehend healthy human-nature relationships, and become a real conservation stewards of their homelands.',

  'programs.community.lishu.reason.1':
    'Cloud Mountain Conservation and the Lishu and Lamahe communities within the community conserved area have jointly explored a conservation model that utilizes an “Eco-Public Affairs Fund” to incentivize community participation in gibbon conservation actions.',
  'programs.community.lishu.reason.2':
    "The core of this model is for community members to implement specific gibbon habitat restoration projects through traditional public deliberations and volunteer labor, with the Cloud Mountain Conservation providing the “Eco-Public Affairs Fund” and inputting other social resources (e.g., women's and children's development groups) needed by the communities to support their own attempts at ecologically sustainable development.",
  'programs.community.lishu.description.1':
    "From 2021 to the present, more than 80% of the families in the Lishu community have been reached by the Women's and Children's Development Group. Through activities such as children's public spaces and English groups, community-wide attention has been mobilized.",
  'programs.community.lishu.description.2':
    'The group has been running for 4 years. The English group has taken on more than 20 volunteers (including 4 volunteers from inside the community), provided nearly 1,000 hours of distance learning support for children, and has run an offline summer program for 3 years.',
  'programs.community.lishu.description.3':
    'In June 2024, based on the English group, the recruitment of growth accompaniment and career development volunteers was added. Currently, 14 volunteers have joined, aiming to provide more accompaniment for children in terms of psychological and professional development.',
  'programs.community.lishu.description.4':
    "From 2021 to 2024, the Lishu Community, led by the Women's Group, received more than Rmb 100,000  in Ecological Public Affairs Funds through the Habitat Restoration Project and Rmb 16,182 through the Food Source Tree Nursery Pilot. In 2023, the Lamahe Community Women's Group formally joined the project, and as of June 2024 has received nearly Rmb 30,000  in public funds.",
  'programs.community.lishu.description.5':
    "In the same year, Cloud Mountain Conservation led the Lishu Community Women's Group and some of its male members to visit Lijiang in Yunnan Province, Qunan in Guangxi Province, and Ruili in Yunnan Province with three topics: women's self-organization development, children's growth, and nature education, in order to learn about ecologically sustainable development explorations in different regions. At the end of the visit, community members mapped their community vision and initiated internal reflection.",

  'programs.community.surround.reason.1':
    'Under the funding of the Shenzhen Zhilan Foundation, Cloudmountain Conservation have started the first round of community surveys aiming at a comprehensive mapping in September 2019 - April 2020. The surveys involved communities located in Sudian, Zhina, and Tengchong where Hoolock tianxing is distributed. We wish to acquire sociological background data on villages associated with Hoolock tianxing via semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. As a result, we might have data supporting in planning future community-based conservation programs.',
  'programs.community.surround.reason.2':
    'In the second round of surveys from August 2021 – May 2022, with proper evaluation of the distribution of the Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon and the result of our questionnaires, we chose Lishu and Lamahe areas in Sudian to carry out PRA (participatory rural appraisal). With the result of PRA, we could document the usage data of natural resources of the Lishu and Lamahe areas. Then we could infer how the livelihoods of the local people are related to the survival needs of the Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon populations, and finally identify the main threats to habitat restoration in the area. Under the guidance of scientific experts, community discussions were held, leading to the development of a community-driven habitat conservation and restoration program.\n',
  'programs.community.surround.description.1':
    "In the first round of surveys, we completed in-depth community interviews with 17 villagers' groups in four major gibbon distribution areas (Houqiao Area, Zhina Area, Mengga-Hexi-Lamahe villages, and Maocao villages in Sudian Area), completed 271 questionnaires in total.\n",
  'programs.community.surround.description.2':
    'The survey concluded that the Lishu-Lamahe areas were the areas with the highest overlap between gibbon habitat and community forests, and were also the areas with lower altitude and relatively more concentrated gibbon populations in Yingjiang. The establishment of a community-driven conservation will have positive effects on increasing habitats forest connectivity and the reproduction rates of gibbon populations in these areas. \n',
  'programs.community.surround.description.3':
    'The PRA survey used the community resource map as a handy aspect to get started, integrating previously known information, aiming at a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of natural resources in the community, and exploring together with the community for a more comprehensive relationship between gibbons and humans.\n',

  'programs.community.yingjiang.reason.1':
    'To meet the conservation needs for protecting Skywalker hoolock gibbon outside of nature reserve boundaries, local neighborhoods’ lack of scientific understanding of gibbons, and the diminishing emotional connection to nature, Cloudmountain Conservation wants to use natural education as a way to empower local conservation forces.\n',
  'programs.community.yingjiang.reason.2':
    'Under support from SEE foundation, we conducted gibbon educational programs for students in neighborhoods near gibbon habitats in Yingjiang County from July 1st, 2020 to November 30th, 2021. This program allows the young generation to gradually understand human-nature relationships and become conservation stewards of their homelands. \n',
  'programs.community.yingjiang.description.1':
    'Combined with the traditional culture of the community, we created a gibbon-themed nature science class to enable the community youth to learn about the local characteristics of the gibbon-oriented environmental knowledge and to develop a sense of scientific conservation. Practices of the program for 3rd-5th grade students of a rural elementary school showed that after 10 lessons, all 107 participants showed significant improvement in gibbon-related ecological knowledge, and some students showed significant improvement in their sense of nature connection.\n',
  'programs.community.yingjiang.description.2':
    "At the same time, we also conducted community nature-experience programs to deepen people's connection with nature and to make their home environment a part of their identity. In this year-long recurring activity, there were about 685 participants, and most of them showed significant improvement in their local identities. \n",
  'programs.community.yingjiang.description.3':
    'In addition to inspiring a conservation willingness and laying the foundation for conservation action, these participatory activities and localized learning scenarios, which are different from traditional classrooms, also have the added impact of helping rural children gain emotional comfort and positive development in nature.\n',

  'programs.habitat.qingshan.reason':
    'As the main distribution area of the Skywalker Hoolock gibbon, Yingjiang County in Dehong Prefecture, Yunnan Province, has a high degree of forest fragmentation in its habitat, and some populations have a very small home range, which makes it difficult to support the needs of population growth. At the same time, some of the lower-elevation forest habitats in Yingjiang County are also productive and living land for communities, with a high degree of anthropogenic disturbance. In order to meet the survival needs of these gibbons living in state-owned forests and community forests, and to further improve the quality and expand the area of existing habitat, we are working with the Forestry Department, township governments, and villagers to explore, through ecological planting, a model of conservation that can provide local communities with a variety of economic sources while also contributing to the long-term survival of gibbon populations.\n',
  'programs.habitat.qingshan.description.1':
    "In March 2022, with the support of the China Environmental Protection Foundation's Meituan Takeout Green Mountain Plan Special Fund, we officially launched a pilot ecological planting project for the Skywalker Hoolock gibbons in Lishu Community, Mengga village, Sudian Township, Ying Jiang County. In the following years, we carried out the Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon’s food tree and vine nursery, light-slope seedling transplantation, and vine replanting in the Lishu and Lamahe to promote the restoration of the plant community structure within the habitat of the Lishu gibbon group. Meanwhile,we have explored community-participatory ecological planting daily management monitoring and long-term habitat restoration plant diversity monitoring.\n",
  'programs.habitat.qingshan.description.2':
    'During the three implementation years from 2022 to 2024, the communities of Lishu and  Lamahe planted woody plants such as wild cherry and Huashan pine, and lianas such as Threeleaf Akebia on barren slopes and comb forest areas. The average survival rate of seedlings planted during the implementation cycle was 97.42% for lianas and 91.95% for woody plants. As of June 2024, a total of 2 square kilometers of the target area of the project has been completed through the restoration of bare ground and the improvement of habitat quality.',

In July 2019, Cloudmountain Conservation received a grant from China Green Carbon Foundation's Small Fund for Combating Illegal Trade in Endangered Wild Animals and Plants, which was used to support the investigation of illegal primate trade and the construction of an information sharing platform.\n",
  'news.illegal.event.1':
    'During 18 months, Cloudmountain Conservation recruited and trained 24 volunteers and set up several investigation teams through continuous training and practice.',
  'news.illegal.event.2':
    'The project was carried out in three major directions: real-time monitoring of illegal trade, data collection from news, and integration of legal document information.\n',
  'news.illegal.event.3':
    'The real-time monitoring team collected a total of 151 pieces of information on illegal trade in primates and submitted a total of 5 complete investigation reports on illegal wildlife trade to the forest police and 3 were solved. The press team collected a total of 285 pieces of information on primate rescue and illegal trade. The legal documentation team collected 745 cases involving illegal trade in primates between 2014 and 2019.\n',

    'Based on this information, in April 2021, the Cloudmountain Conservation Volunteer Team produced the “China Primate Identification and Rescue Manual” and made it available to the public and relevant law enforcement through platforms such as Cloudmountain Conservation, Guoke, and China Green Carbon Foundation, affecting nearly 300 thousand members of the public.\n',

  'news.participation.background':
    'Wildlife conservation requires cooperation and efforts not only from the government, local communities, scientific research teams, and conservation teams, but also from the power of the public. There are many ways to be a part of conservation actions. Some people promote conservation work at the policy level, some people implement those policies locally, some people diligently do research on species protection academically, some people donate generously, and some people promote relevant information to the public... Cloudmountain Conservation realized that public participation is crucial, while the in-depth public participation played a comprehensive and healthy role in primate conservation. Public fundraising is not only financial support to our organization, but also brand communication of endangered species and conservation stories. Any person would go through the progression which could start with reading conservation stories and giving the first donation, then shifting from a single-time donor to a supporter of gibbon conservation.\n',
