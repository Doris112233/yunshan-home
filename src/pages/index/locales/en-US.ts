  'programs.investigation.canteen.reason.1':
    'In Yingjiang County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, which is the main distribution area of Skywalker Hoolock gibbon, Cloudmountain Conservation, together with Yunnan Tongbiguan Provincial Nature Reserve, carried out a comprehensive population survey, which found that the vast majority of the population of Skywalker Hoolock gibbon in Yingjiang County is located in state-owned forests, collective forests, and individual forests outside the Reserve.',
  'programs.investigation.canteen.reason.2':
    'Among them, the distribution of Skywalker Hoolock gibbon population in the Lamahe of Sudian Township, Yingjiang County, is of particular value for conservation. The habitat here is severely fragmented, yet there are five family groups and two solitary apes living in an area of about 13 square kilometers, and the range of activity of the gibbons here is more concentrated than that of the population in the Mt. Gaoligong National Nature Reserve. There is ample evidence that habitats outside protected areas, such as the Lama River area, have been affected by more anthropogenic disturbances, such as roads, logging, forest degradation, and daily production and living activities by neighboring communities, than inside the protected area, but why is this area hosting the most concentrated population of Skywalker Hoolock gibbons in Yingjiang County?',
  'programs.investigation.canteen.reason.3':
    'We propose a possible answer to the above question: the presence of anthropogenic disturbances and habitat degradation outside the reserve, while negatively affecting the survival of gibbons, also acts as a disincentive to potential food competitors of the gibbons, especially other non-human primates; thus the competitive feeding pressure on the populations of the gibbons outside the nature reserves, such as in the Lamahe area, is less than that insides.',
  'programs.investigation.canteen.reason.4':
    'To test this hypothesis, we would like to carry out a survey targeting gibbon food trees in the habitat of Skywalker Hoolock gibbon in the Lama River Area of Yingjiang County. We will select the most important food tree species for Skywalker Hoolock gibbon in each season, and by deploying infrared cameras in the different canopy layers, we will record the whole process of the feeding and all the feeders and compare it with the relevant data in the protected area.',
  'programs.investigation.canteen.description.1':
    'In September 2022, through the fundraising of Tencent Public Welfare\'s "99 Giving Day", we carried out the "Gibbon Canteen Survey Program". Through infrared camera surveys in the canopy, we can validate the existing data on the feeding habits of gibbons in the reserve, collect data on the feeding behaviors of non-habituated gibbon populations, and obtain a list of species that eaten in the "canteen" by gibbons, and yield recommendations for habitat restoration from the perspective of food abundance.',
  'programs.investigation.canteen.description.2':
    'As of March 2024, we have deployed 295 infrared cameras and captured 290,000 infrared images, totaling 12 terabytes, through this project. We have photographed many feeding events of three gibbon groups, and documented over 50 species of birds and 20 other species of animals, including slow lorises and macaques. In addition, the infrared cameras recorded two newborn infants in two different groups respectively, and gibbons were photographed in secondary forests and high altitude areas where we thought gibbons would not go.',
  'programs.investigation.canteen.description.3':
    'A large volume of images and videos needs to be sorted and identified by volunteers. Since the start of the project, we have been recruiting online volunteers, who are interested in conservation and research in wildlife but do not have a scientific background can also contribute. Up to now (May 2024), we have conducted seven rounds of infrared camera deployment, and more than 180 people have signed up and participated in online training to become volunteers for the project. Compared to 2023, we have expanded the survey area in 2024 to clearly understand the range of gibbon activities in this area, especially their feeding range and patterns, and the family dynamics of each family group through long-term monitoring. This will indicate the specific direction and scope of concern for community conservation actions.',

  'programs.community.education.reason':
    'The Wuliang and Ailao Mountain National Nature Reserve in Yunnan Province is a nature reserve in the category of forest ecosystems and wildlife, with the forest ecosystem of the mid-mountain moist evergreen broad-leaved forests and the endangered wildlife there as its main objects of protection. The reserve has rich species resources, including four national first-class protected plant species (Taxus chinensis, Alcimandra cathcartii, etc) and 11 national first-class protected animals (Nomascus concolor, Trachypithecus crepusculus, etc). The nature reserve covers an area of 1,470,000 acres and over 50,000 people live in surrounding areas. In order to better conduct conservation research, educate surrounding neighborhoods to increase conservation awareness, and gain general support from people, Cloudmountain Conservation has been cooperating with institutes like the Jingdong Department of Mt. Wuliang and Ailao National Nature Reserve since 2019. A series of science popularization programs have been done in primary schools near gibbon habitats.',
  'programs.community.education.description.1':
    'From March to July 2019, the "Little Ambassador of Gibbons" science popularization program was carried out in nearby primary schools. There were in-class activities such as "understand gibbons in our hometown" and "protect China\'s gibbon, bring science to campus", themed parties, big frame paintings of gibbons, and so on. The combination of in-class conservation education and themed parties successfully promoted local science popularization a step forward. Local conservation agencies will continuously bring Western Black Crested Gibbon to children living in the mountains in a joyful and informative way.',
  'programs.community.education.description.2':
    'From July to September 2021, the Two Mountain (Wuliang & Ailao) Natural Education and Experience Program developed and conducted many science popularization classes and natural week programs in schools. These programs aimed at helping students to understand and appreciate the local natural environment, allowing local young people to gradually comprehend healthy human-nature relationships, and become a real conservation stewards of their homelands.',
